# Personality
what is exciting to you much
what is the least exciting thing to you
How does your supervisors describe you the best
Tell some situation where you worked independently
Biggest challenge that you faced 

# Written test
Duck typing
Loggers in python- Are they capable of multiple handlers?
Ordered dict in python
SOLID - Design pattern

# Technical round + Live coding
Explain CNN
Number of learnable parameters in CNN
Why dilated conv - global features and computation is relatively less but gives global
Output filter size
Last layer Softmax and output of relu to softmax
Palindrome
Redundancy remover
Overfitting
Data augmentation methods
If one class performs very well compared to an other class, what might be the reason for one class's worst performance given the data distribution is the same?
